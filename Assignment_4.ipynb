This, as one might expect, produced quite wrong results and cost me some time as I thought that the problem was with Logistic Regression model. To sum up, when debugging it is worth to take a look at possibility of things going wrong at data preparation first."

    "This model works differently and performs than previous one. With the same number of max iterations it has lower accuracy (~87% vs ~93%) but works much faster - all due to limited dictionary. It means that it can be worth to cross least siginificant words out to speed up the process (especially when we work on huge datasets), as we can see when comparing times at the end."
